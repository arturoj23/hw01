## A Little bit about me.

Hello my name is Arturo Juarez. I am studying **International Relations** under the Committee of International Relations at the *University of Chicago*. I was born in California but I grew up in both Illinios and and Southern California. As such I consider myself both a Midwesterner and a Californian. My interests incluce reading, outdoor running, and traveling to new destinations both domestically and internationally. 

### More about me

My *hobbies* include playing sports such as basketball, baseball, and volleyball. I enjoy the **outdoors** as much as I enjoy spending a lazy day **indoors**. I care deeply about the social, economic, and civil challenges facing our democracy today and I actively donate my time, energy, and resources to many causes I find of pressing importance. I *source* my news at times from [link](https://www.npr.org/) [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) or [link](https://thehill.com/)
